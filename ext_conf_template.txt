  description = <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Warning this version can work only width css_filelinks version 0.2.0 and higher. This is because in css_filelinks until version 0.2.0 was the DAM integrated but in version 0.2.0 was all DAM stuff removed and so the dam_filelinks must use HOOKS. If you don't want install new css_filelinks version you can use the old but you must use dam_filelinks version 0.2.1 and lower.</span>
